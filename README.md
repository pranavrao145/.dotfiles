# Dotfiles
This repository holds any and all files I use to configure my shell and/or system.

# Usage
Feel free to copy and use whatever you want, but you may have to change the names (in directory references and such) and some other things. This config setup was made for Arch Linux with the i3-gaps window manager, so they will likely (read: definitely) not work out of the box for anything else.
